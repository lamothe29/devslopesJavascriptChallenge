Create a JavaScript object with these keys and values:Create an object with these keys and values:Part 1: ObjectsPart 2: Key CheckerWith one line of code, using built-in JavaScript functionality, determine if ‘’john’’  exists.If the key ‘’Ford’’ exists, delete it from the object, break the loop, then print the  object.

let dealerShip = {
   honda : "crv",
   jeep : "wrangler",
   chrysler : "pacifica",
   ford: "f150",
}
if ('ford' in dealerShip) {
   // console.log('yup, ford exists');
   delete dealerShip.ford;   
}
console.log(dealerShip);






let list = {
   john: 15,
   mark: 17,

console.log(list.hasOwnProperty('john'));






//Create a function that takes an array of two numbers as a parameter.
Advanced: Sum Range  Return the sum of those two numbers, plus all of the numbers in-between.
For example, if you pass in [4,1] your function should return 10 because the  numbers between 1 and 4 is 10.


let arr = [4,5];

function addedEmUp(arr) {
   let smallerNum = Math.min(arr[0], arr[1]);
   let biggerNum = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);

   let sum = 0;
   sum += (smallerNum + biggerNum);

   for (let i = (smallerNum + 1 ); i<biggerNum; i++){
      sum += i;
   }
   return sum;
}

let array1 = [4,1];

console.log(addedEmUp(array1));
