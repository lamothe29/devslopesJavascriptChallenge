Letâ€™s refresh some of your programing skills from previous days. 
Did you know that your loop just ran 100 times, even though you only printed  50 numbers.
Write a function that returns the total count of integers that are not multiples  of either 6 or 15  between a range of 1 and 200.
Advanced: Un-Multiple (Optional)Your task is to now get the operation to be 50% more efficient. That means it  should iterate no more than 50 times while still producing the same result.Call the function and then print all even numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive)


function numbers(){
   for (let i =2; i<=100; i++){
      if (i %2 === 0){
         console.log(i);
      }
   }
}
numbers();

function numbersRefined(){
   for (let i =2; i<=100; i +=2){
       console.log(i);  
   }
}
numbersRefined(); 


function notX6or15(){
   let count = 0;
   for (let i=0; i<=200; i++){
      if (i % 6 !== 0 && i %15 !== 0){
         count++;
      }
   }
   return count;
}
console.log(notX6or15());
